    This is a Python script that connects to an FTP server, downloads files from it,
    and moves them to a local directory. The script uses the ftplib library to interact
    with the FTP server, and os and shutil libraries for file manipulation. The script
    also has a logging function that writes to a log file to keep track of transferred 
    files and errors. The script can be configured using a config.txt file and has customizable
    intervals for file downloads and file movement.

    the 'config.txt' file is accurate.

Hello,

My proposal is for us to connect on LinkedIn and also create a WhatsApp group. My LinkedIn profile can be found at https://www.linkedin.com/in/alin-rizea-b10368104/, and my phone number for WhatsApp is +44 7429 386264.

If you agree with my proposal, please let me know your phone number so I can add you to the WhatsApp group.

As homework, I completed the Hangman game, but I was too lazy to do the weather app. If you would like to check out my solution, you can find it on GitHub: https://github.com/elisrizea/hangman/blob/master/hangman.py

If anyone would like to collaborate with me on creating a weather app, please let me know, and I can set up a GitHub repository to make contributing easy.

Thank you, and have a nice weekend.

Alin Rizea
